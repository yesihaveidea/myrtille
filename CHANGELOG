2018-03-29 Version 1.8.0 (beta)
	resynced FreeRDP with master repository (fixes the NLA issue introduced with Windows updates KB4088776, KB4088787, KB4088876, KB4088875)
	added support for MFA (one time password and one time host session url) (thanks Paul Oliver). Refer to documentation for activation
	added enterprise mode (AD pre-authentication and hosts list management) (thanks Paul Oliver). Refer to documentation for activation
	in enterprise mode, the security mode for the host connection is now configurable (NLA, TLS, RDP, etc.)
	most FreeRDP connection params are now configurable (myrtille\bin\Myrtille.Services.exe.config)
	the remote clipboard can now be disabled, for enhanced security (myrtille\Web.config)
	replaced client redirects by server redirects (cleaner and more friendly to proxies)
	added more connection details to myrtille logs

2018-02-07 Version 1.7.0 (stable)
	resynced FreeRDP with master repository; FreeRDP 2.0-RC2 milestone: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/8
	FreeRDP HOTFIX: connection using FQDN is broken (either direct connection or through a connection broker redirection), using target IP instead
	FreeRDP HOTFIX: fixed client IP resolution when using an ipv6 connection
	updated the connection tooltip (ipv6 addresses require brackets, i.e. [::1])
	changed the right-click button mechanism to a toggle

2017-12-09 Version 1.6.1 (stable)
	enabled fonts smoothing
	modified disconnect button tooltip
	removed pipes messages size limitation
	pipes are no longer buffered
	added support for multiple websockets on a single remote session to allow for collaborative mode (was already supported using long-polling). To share a remote session, simply copy and share the session url (contains the session id). CAUTION! this is experimental (no access control, no presenter role, etc.)
	enforced wfreerdp process identity on pipes access rule
	pipes are now used in byte mode instead of message (small performance improvement)
	remote session is now closed in case of pipes failure instead of being stuck

2017-11-14 Version 1.6.0 (stable)
	resynced FreeRDP with master repository; among other things, fixes multiple vulnerabilities reported by the Cisco Talos Team (http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/vulnerbility-spotlight-freerdp-multiple.html) (thanks hac)
	ignore certificate warning (when using NLA); may happen, for example, with a self-signed certificate (not trusted) or if the server joined a domain after the certificate was issued (name mismatch). more details here: http://www.vkernel.ro/blog/configuring-certificates-in-2012r2-remote-desktop-services-rds (required with the latest FreeRDP build)
	connection settings (including user credentials) are no longer passed to FreeRDP through command line; using pipe communication instead (thanks Paul)
	auto-connect / start program from url now doesn't require the "&program=" parameter (access to the desktop if missing or empty) (thanks noetius)
	custom mouse cursors are now supported with IE (thanks Thijs)
	added a "Right-Click" button (into the toolbar) to simulate a right-click action on devices which don't have a mouse (or a right button) (thanks Scott)
	performance tweak: now using PNG encoding by default (instead of mixed PNG/JPEG); drawback is it uses more bandwidth with graphic applications (use AUTO encoding in this case; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled mouse move sampling; drawback is it may lower the responsiveness with graphical applications (enable the sampling in this case; 10% for example; config.js)
	performance tweak: disabled blob support (using base64 instead); blob is a newer javascript construct but is cached on disk whereas base64 data is cached in memory (faster); config.js
	minor refactoring

2017-07-27 Version 1.5.0 (stable)
	changed prerequisites: IIS 8+ with websocket protocol enabled and .NET 4.5 (instead of .NET 4.0)
	replaced Fleck websocket server by IIS 8+ websocket handler (now using standard 80 and 443 ports)
	added websocket binary communication (no more base64 33% bandwidth overhead)
	added session fixation protection (a new session ID is generated upon login)
	added custom port support (i.e.: IIS Express uses port 2323)
	fixed installer issue if both IIS and IIS Express are available on the target machine
	fixed building issue with CERTENROLLLib (COM object) under Windows 10 (thanks mak1311)
	fixed the blue mouse pointer shadow
	fixed a (myrtille) read access violation regarding the mouse pointer (c0000005 exception code)
	fixed a (FreeRDP) read access violation regarding the H264 codec init, when available on the client machine (c0000005 exception code)
	disabled H264 (Myrtille does process bitmaps updates, not video streams)
	fixed remote clipboard under IE (wasn't displayed into the popup)
	increased max file upload/download size up to 1GB (tweakable into Myrtille.Web and Myrtille.Services configs, if needed)
	improved UI (stat, debug and rendering mode are now hidden by default into default.css, customizable logo, myrtille version, etc.)
	the remote session log is now configurable into Myrtille.Services config (disabled by default)
	the remote session display is now responsive (scale to browser size, disabled by default)
	if starting a program from url without setting a display resolution, it's auto-detetected from the client
	"start program from url" feature now supports hashed passwords (aka "password 51" into .rdp files)
	commands can now be sent directly from the browser (i.e.: image quality tweak depending on the available bandwidth)
	simplified config.js (added enums and autodetection for major settings)
	customizable framerate (into config.js)
	resynced the myrtille FreeRDP fork with the FreeRDP master repository
